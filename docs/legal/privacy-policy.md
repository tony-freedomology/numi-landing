# Zoe Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 27, 2026  
Last updated: February 27, 2026

Zoe is an SMS-based discipleship companion operated by Freedomology ("Zoe", "we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect, how we use it, when we share it, and the choices available to users.

## 1. Scope
This policy applies to Zoe's websites, SMS experience, church admin features, and support operations where this policy is posted or linked.

## 2. Core Commitments
- **Private by default:** one-to-one message content is private by default.
- **Church visibility is aggregated:** church dashboards are intended for trend-level analytics, not member-level private transcripts.
- **Restricted human access:** internal access to sensitive data is role-based, time-bounded when possible, and logged.
- **AI-sharing controls:** optional data-sharing for AI improvement is opt-in by default unless you explicitly enable it.
- **User control:** users can request export and deletion rights as described below.

## 3. Information We Collect
### 3.1 Information you provide
- Phone number and verification-related messaging metadata
- Optional name and profile preferences
- Church affiliation (if using a church-provided Zoe instance)
- Conversation content you send to Zoe
- Support requests and privacy requests

### 3.2 Information generated through use
- Outbound messages, timestamps, and delivery events
- Onboarding responses, cadence settings, and preference selections
- Memory/context records used for continuity and follow-up
- Audit and consent records tied to privacy-sensitive operations

### 3.3 Account, billing, and security information
- Subscription status and billing identifiers from payment providers
- Authentication events and access logs
- Device/IP and request metadata used for abuse prevention, reliability, and security monitoring

## 4. How We Use Information
We use personal information to:
- Operate Zoe’s conversational SMS experience
- Provide daily devotional touchpoints and follow-ups
- Personalize responses using prior context and configured memory settings
- Run safety workflows, including crisis escalation pathways
- Support church-level analytics in aggregate form
- Process billing, prevent fraud, and maintain service reliability
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms

## 5. AI Processing and Model Providers
To provide responses, relevant context may be processed by contracted AI providers. Our objective is to:
- send only the data needed for service functionality,
- configure provider controls to limit secondary use where available, and
- keep optional AI-improvement sharing disabled by default unless you opt in.

## 6. Church Relationship and Data Boundaries
If your church offers Zoe:
- Your account may be associated with that church.
- Church leaders may view aggregate trends (for example topic-level patterns and engagement summaries).
- Church dashboards are not intended to expose your private one-to-one conversation transcripts by default.
- Any exception workflow should require explicit consent and audit logging.

## 7. When We Share Information
We may share information:
- **With service providers** that host, transmit, process, secure, and support Zoe (for example infrastructure, AI inference, SMS, billing, and monitoring providers).
- **For legal reasons** when required by law, court order, subpoena, or other lawful process.
- **For safety reasons** to help prevent imminent harm to a person where legally permitted.
- **In a business transfer** (for example merger, acquisition, financing, or asset sale), subject to applicable confidentiality and legal safeguards.

We do not sell personal information for money.

## 8. Consent and Privacy Controls
Depending on product availability and your role, controls may include:
- Memory mode controls
- AI-improvement opt-in/opt-out controls
- Human support access controls
- Retention profile controls

When material consent states change, we maintain consent event records for accountability.

## 9. Data Retention
We retain data for as long as reasonably necessary to:
- provide the service,
- maintain safety/security logs,
- satisfy legal, accounting, or dispute obligations, and
- enforce agreements.

Retention windows may vary by data category. Backup deletion may follow delayed overwrite cycles and may not be immediate.

## 10. Security
We use layered technical and organizational safeguards, including:
- encryption in transit,
- role-based access controls and least-privilege principles,
- authentication protections,
- logging and monitoring of sensitive access paths.

No internet service can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## 11. Safety and Crisis Workflows
Zoe may detect crisis language and trigger safety-oriented workflows. Where feasible, Zoe follows a consent-first approach, with narrow exceptions for urgent life-safety scenarios.

## 12. Your Rights and Choices
Subject to applicable law, you may request:
- access to personal data we hold about you,
- correction of inaccurate data,
- export of certain data,
- deletion of specific content or account-level deletion,
- changes to optional consent settings.

## 13. U.S. State Privacy Disclosures
Residents of certain U.S. states (for example California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and others with applicable privacy laws) may have additional rights, including rights to know, delete, correct, and opt out of certain processing categories. We will process verified requests as required by applicable law.

## 14. Children
Zoe is not intended for children under 13. If we learn that personal information from a child under 13 was collected without required authorization, we will take steps to delete it as required by law.

## 15. International Processing
Data may be processed in the United States and other countries where we or our processors operate. Where required, we apply appropriate safeguards for cross-border processing.

## 16. Changes to this Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by an updated effective date and, where appropriate, additional notice.
