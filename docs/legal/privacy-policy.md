# Zoe Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 27, 2026

## 1. Overview
Zoe is an SMS-based discipleship companion. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and the controls available to users and church partners.

## 2. Core Privacy Commitments
- Private by default: one-to-one conversation content is private by default.
- Church-level visibility is aggregated: church dashboards are designed for trend-level insights rather than member-level private conversation transcripts.
- Human access is restricted: internal access to sensitive data is limited, role-based, and auditable.
- AI improvement/training sharing is opt-in: by default, user content is not shared for optional model-improvement programs.
- User control: users can request export or deletion of their data.

## 3. Information We Collect
### 3.1 Account and profile data
- Phone number
- Optional name
- Timezone and preference settings
- Church affiliation (if applicable)

### 3.2 Conversation and product data
- Inbound and outbound message content
- Message metadata (timestamps, delivery identifiers)
- Memory/context records used for follow-up support
- Onboarding responses and preference settings

### 3.3 Operational and security data
- Authentication and access metadata
- Request identifiers and abuse-prevention telemetry
- Audit logs related to sensitive data access and consent changes

### 3.4 Billing data
- Subscription state
- Payment-provider customer/subscription identifiers
- Billing events required to run the service

## 4. How We Use Information
We use data to:
- Deliver conversational responses and daily touchpoints
- Personalize memory-based follow-ups
- Support safety workflows, including crisis detection
- Operate church-level aggregated analytics
- Run billing, reliability, support, and fraud prevention
- Meet legal and security obligations

## 5. AI Processing
To provide Zoe’s responses, relevant conversation context may be sent to contracted AI providers.

Our policy intent:
- Use AI provider settings and contractual terms designed to limit use to service delivery.
- Minimize data sent to what is necessary for product functionality.
- Keep optional AI-improvement sharing as opt-in (default off).

## 6. Sharing and Disclosure
### 6.1 With churches
- Church-facing analytics are intended to be aggregate and de-identified.
- Personal conversation content is not intended for default church dashboard visibility.

### 6.2 With service providers
We use third-party processors for infrastructure, messaging, AI inference, billing, and monitoring under contractual controls.

### 6.3 Legal and safety disclosures
We may disclose limited information when required by law or when necessary to reduce imminent risk of serious harm.

## 7. Consent and User Controls
Zoe supports privacy controls that may include:
- Memory mode preferences
- AI-improvement sharing preference
- Human support access settings
- Retention profile settings

We maintain consent records and support revocation for optional settings.

## 8. Data Retention and Deletion
We retain information only as long as needed for service operation, security, and legal obligations.

Users can request:
- Data export
- Deletion of specific content
- Full account deletion

Backup deletion follows system retention schedules and may not be immediate.

## 9. Security
We apply layered safeguards, including:
- Encryption in transit
- Access controls and least-privilege permissions
- Auditable logging for sensitive access paths
- Ongoing operational security controls

No internet service is risk-free, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 10. Safety Workflows
Zoe may detect crisis language and trigger safety-oriented responses.

Our operational approach is consent-first whenever possible, with narrow exceptions for urgent life-safety scenarios.

## 11. International Processing
Data may be processed in different regions depending on infrastructure and provider locations. Appropriate safeguards are applied where required.

## 12. Children
Zoe is not intended for users who are below the minimum age required by applicable law without appropriate authorization.

## 13. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy. Material changes will be reflected by an updated effective date and, where appropriate, additional notice.
