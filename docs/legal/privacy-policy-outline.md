# Zoe Privacy Policy Outline (Draft)

This is a product-policy draft for legal review, not final legal text.

## 1) Privacy Promise (Plain English Summary)
- Your messages are private by default.
- Your church does not see your personal conversation content unless you explicitly share it.
- Human access at Zoe is blocked by default and only allowed under strict controls.
- AI processing is used to generate replies and core product functionality.
- AI model training on your data is opt-in only (default off).
- You can export or delete your data.

## 2) Scope and Definitions
- Service: Zoe SMS discipleship assistant and related dashboard features.
- User content: SMS messages, responses, journal-style reflections, memory items, preferences.
- Church analytics: aggregated and de-identified insights (not member-level conversation content).
- Providers: infrastructure, messaging, AI, and payment vendors under contractual controls.

## 3) What We Collect
- Account/contact data:
  - Phone number, optional name, timezone, church affiliation (if applicable).
- Conversation data:
  - Inbound/outbound SMS content, timestamps, message metadata.
- Memory/context data:
  - Extracted reminders, commitments, and follow-up context.
- Billing data:
  - Subscription status and billing identifiers from payment processor.
- Security/operations data:
  - Access logs, device/browser metadata, webhook signatures, fraud/rate-limit telemetry.

## 4) How We Use Data
- Deliver daily touchpoints and on-demand replies.
- Personalize follow-ups and memory-based reminders.
- Detect crisis language and trigger safety workflows.
- Provide church-level aggregate analytics.
- Run billing, abuse prevention, reliability, and support workflows.

## 5) AI Processing and Model Providers
- User content is sent to AI providers only for inference needed to operate Zoe.
- We configure provider settings/contracts to prohibit model training on customer content unless a user explicitly opts in.
- We only send the minimum context required for useful responses.
- We will maintain and publish a current provider list and processing purposes.

## 6) Data Sharing
- With churches:
  - Aggregated/de-identified trends only by default.
  - No private one-to-one conversation access by church staff by default.
- With service providers:
  - Strictly for operations (SMS delivery, hosting, AI inference, billing, monitoring).
- Legal/safety exceptions:
  - Limited disclosure when required by law or to prevent imminent harm.

## 7) User Controls and Consent
- Privacy settings:
  - Memory mode: Off / Standard / Deep.
  - AI improvement sharing: Off by default (opt-in).
  - Human support access: Off by default; time-limited when enabled.
  - Church sharing mode: Aggregated only by default.
  - Retention profile: configurable limits.
- Consent records:
  - Consent events are timestamped and auditable.
  - Users can revoke optional consents at any time.

## 8) Safety and Escalation
- We use crisis detection to identify high-risk content.
- We follow a consent-first escalation model whenever possible.
- For imminent risk scenarios, minimum necessary information may be used/shared to protect life and safety.
- Safety workflows are logged and auditable.

## 9) Security Controls (Technical + Organizational)
- Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- Least-privilege access controls and role-based permissions.
- MFA for privileged/admin access.
- Immutable access audit logs for sensitive reads/actions.
- Regular dependency patching and incident response runbooks.
- Encrypted backups and restoration testing.

## 10) Retention and Deletion
- We retain data only as long as needed for service, legal, and security obligations.
- Messages and memory data use retention windows and deletion lifecycle controls.
- Users can request:
  - Export of their data.
  - Deletion of specific memories/messages.
  - Full account deletion.
- Backup retention and deletion timing are documented transparently.

## 11) User Rights
