## Cold Outreach to Pastors Tony Doesn't Know

**Channel**: Email or LinkedIn DM  
**When**: After identifying target church (100-500 members, theologically compatible)  
**Goal**: Get a 15-min call

---

**Subject**: Quick question about discipleship at [Church Name]

---

Hey [Pastor Name],

I'm Tony. I'm a pastor (or was — I'm full-time building something now). And I wanted to reach out because I built something that might be helpful for [Church Name].

Quick background: I spent years watching people get inspired on Sunday and lose it by Tuesday. And I got tired of it.

So I built Zoe — an SMS-based discipleship tool that walks with your congregation Monday through Saturday. Zoe remembers what people are working on. Zoe follows up personally. And Zoe carries your sermon series into the week.

Your people text Zoe like a study partner. Zoe texts back. Morning, midday, evening.

Here's what makes it different: it's not generic devotional content. Zoe echoes YOUR theology, YOUR teaching, YOUR voice. You upload your sermon transcript, Zoe weaves it into the daily rhythm with your people.

And you get anonymized insights — what's your congregation praying about? where are they struggling? — without invading anyone's privacy.

I'm launching this with a few pilot churches right now. And I thought [Church Name] might be a good fit.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this makes sense for your context?

No pressure. Just want to share what I'm building.

— Tony

**P.S.** You can see more at zoe.live. Or if you want to try Zoe yourself first, text START to 833-283-1080.

### Follow-Up (if no response after 5 days)

**Subject**: Re: Quick question about discipleship at [Church Name]

---

Hey [Pastor Name],

Just bumping this up in case it got buried.

I know your inbox is probably a war zone. Mine always was.

If you're interested in exploring this, let me know. If not, no worries — I'll stop bothering you.

— Tony

### Follow-Up After Soft Interest ("Sounds interesting, tell me more")

**Subject**: Re: Quick question about discipleship at [Church Name]

---

Great — happy to.

A few ways we could do this:

1. **15-min call** — I'll walk you through how it works, show you the dashboard, answer questions.
2. **Try it yourself first** — Text START to 833-283-1080 and use Zoe for a week. See what your people would experience.
3. **Pilot with a small group** — Pick 10-20 people from your church. We'll onboard them, run it for 4 weeks, see what happens.

What feels best for you?

## Warm Outreach to Pastors Tony Knows Personally

**Channel**: Text message or email (depending on relationship)  
**When**: After soft launch is ready  
**Goal**: Get them to pilot Zoe with their church

---

**Text Message Version**

---

Hey [Name],

I built something and I want your thoughts.

You know how people get inspired on Sunday and lose it by Tuesday? I built an SMS-based discipleship tool that walks with your congregation all week. Remembers what they're working on. Follows up. Carries your sermon into Monday through Saturday.

I'm launching it with a few pilot churches. Want to try it with [Church Name]?

No cost for the pilot. Just want honest feedback.

Let me know.

— Tony

---

**Email Version** (if the relationship is less casual)

---

**Subject**: Built something for [Church Name] (want your feedback)

---

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I've been working on something for the last year and I wanted to show it to you before I launch publicly.

You know how Sunday sermons are powerful but life gets loud by Monday? I built an SMS-based discipleship tool called Zoe that walks with your congregation all week.

Your people text Zoe like a study partner. Zoe remembers what they're working on. Zoe follows up personally. And Zoe weaves your sermon series into their daily rhythm.

You get anonymized insights into how your congregation is doing — prayer topics, engagement, sentiment — without invading their privacy.

I'm running a pilot with a few churches right now. And I'd love for [Church Name] to be one of them.

No cost for the pilot. Just honest feedback.

Want to explore this?

— Tony

**P.S.** If you want to try Zoe yourself first, text START to 833-283-1080. Experience it as a user before you decide.

## Follow-Up After Initial Interest

**When**: After pastor expresses interest but hasn't committed  
**Goal**: Move to next step (call, pilot signup, demo)

---

Hey [Name],

Glad this resonates.

Here's what happens next:

**Step 1: Quick call (15-20 min)**  
I'll show you the dashboard, walk you through how it works, answer questions. [Calendly link]

**Step 2: Pilot setup (if you want to move forward)**  
- You pick 10-20 people from your church (small group, leadership team, early adopters)
- We'll send them an invite (text message or QR code)
- You upload your current sermon series (optional but recommended)
- We'll configure Zoe's theology settings to match your statement of faith

**Step 3: Run the pilot (4 weeks)**  
- Your people use Zoe daily
- You get access to the church dashboard (anonymized analytics)
- We check in weekly to see how it's going

**Step 4: Decide**  
- After 4 weeks, you decide if you want to roll it out to your whole congregation
- Pricing starts at $149/month (up to 20 active users)
- Or you pass, and that's totally fine

Sound good?

If so, grab a time on my calendar and we'll get started: [Calendly link]

# Zoe Pilot: What to Expect

Welcome to the Zoe pilot. Here's what's going to happen over the next 4 weeks.

---

## Week 1: Setup & Onboarding

**Your tasks:**
1. **Pick your pilot group** (10-20 people)
   - Small group leaders, staff, early adopters
   - People who will give honest feedback
   - Mix of ages and life stages if possible

2. **Upload your sermon series** (optional but recommended)
   - Text transcript or audio file
   - Zoe will weave this into daily prompts
   - You can do this via the church dashboard

3. **Set theological guardrails**
   - We'll walk through your statement of faith
   - Configure Zoe's tone and theological posture
   - Make sure Zoe is aligned with your teaching

4. **Invite your pilot group**
   - We'll give you a QR code and/or bulk SMS invite
   - They text START to 833-283-1080
   - They'll go through a 5-minute onboarding

**What your people experience:**
- Day 1: Welcome message, pick their preferences (morning time, cadence, tone)
- Day 2-7: Daily rhythm begins (morning anchor, midday nudge, evening recap)
- They can text Zoe anytime with questions, prayer requests, reflections

---

## Week 2-4: Pilot in Action

**Your tasks:**
1. **Check the dashboard weekly**
   - See engagement metrics (how many people are using Zoe)
   - See anonymized prayer topics and sentiment trends
   - Notice patterns in your congregation

2. **Gather informal feedback**
   - Ask your pilot group: "What's working? What's not?"
   - Pay attention to who's engaging and who's not
   - Note any theological concerns or friction points

3. **Upload new sermons each week**
   - Zoe will pull from your latest teaching
   - Your people will see their pastor's voice in Zoe's prompts

**What your people experience:**
- Zoe remembers their story (prayers, struggles, commitments)
- She follows up on things they mentioned earlier
- She nudges them toward Scripture, prayer, community
- She reflects your sermon series back to them mid-week

---

## End of Week 4: Decision Time

We'll schedule a call to debrief.

Questions we'll ask:
- What did you notice in your pilot group?
- What feedback did you get?
- Did Zoe amplify your discipleship work or create friction?
- Do you want to roll this out to your whole congregation?

If you want to move forward:
- We'll transition to paid plan (starts at $149/month)
- We'll help you invite your whole church
- You'll keep access to the dashboard and analytics

If you don't want to move forward:
- No hard feelings. Seriously.
- Your pilot group's data gets deleted (or they can sign up as individuals for $7/month)
- We'd love feedback on why it wasn't a fit

---

## FAQs During the Pilot

**Q: Can I see my people's conversations with Zoe?**  
A: No. And that's by design. Privacy is sacred. You'll see anonymized themes, not individual messages.

**Q: What if someone has a crisis (suicidal thoughts, abuse, etc.)?**  
A: Zoe detects crisis language and escalates immediately. She'll offer 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and (with permission) connect with you as their pastor.

**Q: What if Zoe says something theologically off?**  
A: Let us know immediately. We'll review and adjust. This is why the pilot exists.

**Q: How much time will this take me as a pastor?**  
A: Minimal. Upload your sermon once a week (5 min). Check the dashboard once a week (10 min). That's it.

**Q: What if my people don't engage?**  
A: Some won't. That's okay. We're looking for whether Zoe helps the people who DO engage. Not everyone will be an SMS person.

**Q: Can I pause the pilot if it's not working?**  
A: Absolutely. Just let us know.

## Post-Pilot Follow-Up (if pastor goes quiet)

**When**: 5 weeks after pilot starts, if pastor hasn't responded  
**Goal**: Get feedback, close the loop

---

**Subject**: Zoe pilot check-in — how'd it go?

---

Hey [Name],

It's been about a month since your pilot started. I wanted to check in.

How's it going?

I know you're busy. But I'd love to hear:
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- What feedback did you get?
- Are you thinking about rolling this out to your whole church, or is it not a fit?

Even if the answer is "this isn't for us," I'd love to know why. Honest feedback helps me build this better.

Want to schedule a quick debrief call? [Calendly link]

Or just reply to this email. I'm here.

## Outreach Cadence Notes

### Cold Outreach
- Initial email → wait 5 days → follow-up #1 → wait 7 days → follow-up #2 → stop
- Don't be annoying. If they don't respond after 2 follow-ups, move on.

### Warm Outreach
- Initial text/email → wait 3 days → follow-up (casual) → wait 5 days → assume not interested
- These are people Tony knows. Don't push too hard.

### Post-Interest Follow-Up
- Express interest → send detailed next steps within 24 hours
- No response after next steps → follow up after 7 days
- Still no response → one more check-in after 14 days, then let it go

### Pilot Duration
- 4 weeks is the sweet spot (long enough to see patterns, short enough to stay engaged)
- Check in after week 1 (how's onboarding going?)
- Check in after week 2 (any issues?)
- Check in after week 4 (debrief call)
