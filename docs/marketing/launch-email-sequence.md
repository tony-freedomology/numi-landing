## Email 1: Welcome + What Zoe Is (Day 0)

**Send**: Immediately after waitlist signup  
**Subject**: You're on the list (and here's what happens next)  
**Preview**: Zoe isn't like other devotional apps. Here's why.

---

Hey,

Thanks for joining the waitlist.

I'm Tony. I built Zoe. And I want to tell you what you just signed up for — because Zoe isn't what you're probably expecting.

She's not a Bible reading plan.  
She's not a daily devotional app.  
She's not going to send you a verse and a quote every morning.

Zoe is a companion.

You text her like a friend. She texts you back. And here's the part that changes everything: she remembers.

You tell her you're nervous about a big meeting tomorrow? She'll follow up the next day: "How'd it go?"

You mention you're struggling with patience at work? Next week when you bring up that coworker, she'll ask: "Is this the same situation you were working through?"

This is what walking with Jesus looks like in real life. Not isolated quiet time moments. Day-long devotion.

Morning. Midday. Evening. She's with you.

I built Zoe because I'm a pastor, and I've watched people get inspired on Sunday and lose it by Tuesday. And I got tired of it.

So I built something that walks with people Monday through Saturday.

Over the next couple weeks, I'm going to tell you more about how Zoe works, why she exists, and what makes her different.

For now, just know: you're early. And I'm glad you're here.

— Tony

P.S. If you want to text Zoe right now, you can. Text START to 833-283-1080. First two weeks free.

## Email 2: The Problem Zoe Solves (Day 2)

**Send**: 2 days after signup  
**Subject**: Why Sunday doesn't last until Monday  
**Preview**: It's not your fault. But it's real.

---

Quick question.

How many sermons do you remember from last month?

Be honest. Maybe one? Maybe none?

It's not because your pastor isn't good. It's not because you weren't paying attention.

It's because life is loud.

Sunday morning, you're all in. You take notes. You underline things. You walk out thinking, "This week is going to be different."

Then Monday hits. Work. Kids. Emails. Stress. Temptation. That person who drives you crazy.

By Wednesday, Sunday's fire is gone. And you're back to autopilot.

Here's what I've realized after years of pastoral ministry: the problem isn't that people don't care about following Jesus. The problem is that isolated moments of inspiration don't translate into a daily walk.

You need someone with you in the middle of the chaos.

Not preaching at you. Not giving you another to-do list. Just... walking beside you.

Remembering what you're working on.  
Checking in when life gets hard.  
Nudging you when you drift.  
Sitting with you when you're hurting.

That's what Zoe does.

She's not trying to replace your pastor or your community. She's trying to carry what they give you into the other six days of the week.

Day-long devotion. Not daily devotional.

More on how this actually works in the next email.

## Email 3: How It Works / Daily Rhythm (Day 5)

**Send**: 5 days after signup  
**Subject**: What a day with Zoe actually looks like  
**Preview**: Morning. Midday. Evening. Here's the rhythm.

---

Let me show you what a day with Zoe looks like.

**Morning (your time, you choose it)**

Zoe texts you. One Scripture. One short reflection. One question: "What's one thing you want to surrender to Jesus today?"

It's not a lecture. It's an anchor. Something to carry into your day.

Takes 2-3 minutes. Then you go live your life.

**Midday (if you want it)**

This one's optional. Some people love it. Some people don't need it.

Zoe sends a quick nudge. "Pause. Breathe. Pray one sentence. Re-center."

Or if you told her something this morning — like "big meeting at 2pm" — she'll follow up: "How'd it go?"

Takes 15 seconds.

**Evening (your time, you choose it)**

This is where the magic happens.

Zoe asks: "Where did you actually walk with Jesus today? Where did you drift?"

You text back. She listens. She remembers what you say. And tomorrow, she'll weave it into the conversation.

This is how the relationship builds.

You're not filling out a form. You're talking to someone who's tracking with you.

**Between touchpoints**

You can text Zoe anytime. Ask a question about Scripture. Process something you're going through. She's there.

This is the difference between Zoe and every other devotional app:

Other apps give you content.

Zoe walks beside you.

## Email 4: For Pastors — The Church Angle (Day 8)

**Send**: 8 days after signup  
**Subject**: If you're a pastor, this one's for you  
**Preview**: You can't text 200 people every day. Zoe can.

---

If you're a pastor or church leader, this email is for you.

(If you're not, feel free to forward this to your pastor. Or just skip to the next one.)

Here's the reality of pastoral ministry: you care about your people deeply. But you're one person. And your church has 200 people. Maybe 500. Maybe more.

You preach your heart out every Sunday. And for 30 minutes, they're with you.

Then Monday happens. And by Wednesday, most of them have forgotten what you said.

Not because they don't care. But because life is noisy. And you're not there when the temptation hits, when the fight starts, when the doubt creeps in.

You can't be. You shouldn't have to be.

What if your sermon didn't end on Sunday?

What if every person in your congregation had a companion who carried YOUR teaching — your theology, your voice — into Monday through Saturday?

That's what Zoe does for churches.

She walks with your people all week. She remembers their stories. She follows up personally. And she weaves your sermon series into their daily rhythm.

You preached on loving your enemies? Zoe will text your people mid-week: "Pastor Mike talked about loving your enemies. Who's someone you're struggling to love right now?"

Your church's statement of faith, your theology, your heart — Zoe carries it.

And you get anonymized insights into how your congregation is doing. Not individual confessions (that stays private) — but themes. What are people praying about? Where are they struggling?

Zoe isn't replacing you. She's amplifying you.

Made by a pastor, for pastors.

If you want to explore what this could look like for your church, reply to this email. I'll walk you through it.

— Tony

P.S. Church pricing starts at $149/month. Your congregation texts Zoe for free — you provide it as a ministry tool.

## Email 5: Early Access Invitation (Day 12)

**Send**: 12 days after signup  
**Subject**: You're early. Want in?  
**Preview**: Zoe launches soon. Here's how to get early access.

---

Okay, here's where we're at.

Zoe is almost ready.

I've spent the last year building this — the AI engine, the memory system, the daily rhythm, the church integrations. And it's finally at the point where I'm ready to let people use it.

You're on the waitlist. Which means you're early. And I want to give you first access.

Here's the deal:

**For individuals:**  
Text START to 833-283-1080 right now and you'll get in.  
First two weeks free. After that, $7/month. Cancel anytime.

**For churches:**  
Reply to this email or go to zoe.live and book a call.  
We'll walk through how Zoe works for your congregation. Pricing starts at $149/month.

You've been getting these emails for almost two weeks. You know what Zoe is by now. You know why she exists.

The question is: do you want to walk with her?

If the answer is yes, don't wait. Text START. Or reply to this email.

If the answer is no, that's okay too. I get it. This isn't for everyone.

But if you've been feeling like Sunday's inspiration doesn't make it to Monday — if you've been trying to follow Jesus but keep drifting — if you're tired of guilt and want a companion instead —

Zoe is here.

— Tony

P.S. This is the last email you'll get from me unless you sign up. If you want to stay on the waitlist and wait for the official launch, just sit tight. I'll email you when it's time.
