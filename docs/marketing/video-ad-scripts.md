# Zoe Video Ad Scripts

All scripts written for Tony Allen to deliver naturally to camera. Voice: conversational, honest, pastor-hearted. No script should feel "read."

## 30-Second Social Media Ad (Hook-Heavy)

**VISUAL**: Tony looking directly at camera, casual setting (coffee shop or home office)

**TONY**:  
Sunday morning — you're all in. The sermon hits, you're inspired, you're ready to actually follow Jesus this week.

*(slight pause, knowing look)*

Then Monday happens.

*(cut to phone screen showing Zoe text message)*

What if you had a study partner that remembered what you're working on — and actually checked in later to see how it went?

Not a daily devotional. Day-long devotion.

I'm Tony. I'm a pastor. And I built Zoe because I was tired of watching people lose Sunday's fire by Tuesday.

## 60-Second YouTube Pre-Roll / Instagram Ad

**VISUAL**: Tony sitting, casual but intentional. Warm lighting. Maybe holding coffee.

**TONY**:  
Here's the thing about being a Christian in 2026.

Sunday mornings? Powerful. Your pastor preaches, you take notes, you feel it.

But Monday through Saturday? That's where real life happens. And most of us — if we're honest — we drift.

*(leans forward slightly)*

What does life with Jesus actually look like in the middle of Tuesday stress, Wednesday temptation, Friday exhaustion?

*(pause)*

I'm Tony. I'm a pastor. And I built something called Zoe — an SMS-based discipleship tool that walks with you all day.

Zoe remembers what you shared yesterday. Zoe follows up later. "How'd that conversation with your boss go?" "Did you get time in that passage you wanted to read?"

*(addressing the elephant)*

Now — is this AI? Yeah. And I get it. Some of you are thinking, "AI and faith? Really?"

Here's how I see it: AI's a mirror for humanity. It'll be used for all kinds of things that pull people away from Jesus. But what if it could pull people TOWARD him instead?

Zoe isn't here to replace your pastor, your small group, your community. If Zoe does its job right, it's nudging you toward those things.

Day-long devotion. Not daily devotional.

## 90-Second Long Form (Tony Talking to Camera)

**VISUAL**: Tony sitting comfortably, natural setting (home, church office, or outdoors). Feels like a friend talking to you, not a pitch.

**TONY**:  
I've been a pastor for years. And I've watched the same thing happen over and over again.

Sunday comes. Sermon's good. People are engaged. They take notes. They feel inspired. They leave church ready to actually live differently.

*(pause, slight smile)*

By Wednesday? It's gone.

Not because they don't care. Not because they don't want to follow Jesus. Because life is noisy. Work is stressful. Kids are loud. Temptations are real. And Sunday's fire doesn't make it through the week.

*(shift in tone, more personal)*

I kept thinking — what if there was a guide who could walk with you all week? Not preach at you. Not give you another to-do list. Just... be with you.

Something that remembers what you're struggling with. That follows up later to ask how it went. That nudges you when you need it and stays with you when you're hurting.

That's why I built Zoe.

Zoe's an SMS-based discipleship tool. You text Zoe like a study partner. Zoe texts you back. Morning, midday, evening — your daily rhythm with God.

Zoe remembers. That's the key. You mention you're nervous about an interview at 2pm? Zoe will text you later: "How'd it go?"

You share you want to read the book of James this week? Friday comes, Zoe will check in: "Did you get to it?"

*(addressing the AI question head-on)*

Now — some of you are wondering: AI and faith? Really?

I get it. AI makes people nervous. And honestly? It should. AI is a mirror for humanity. It'll absolutely be used for things that pull people away from Jesus.

But that's not a reason to run FROM it. It's a reason to run TOWARD it with intention.

What if AI could be used for the Kingdom? What if it could help people walk closer to Jesus, not further away?

That's the bet I'm making with Zoe.

*(pause, softer)*

Zoe isn't replacing your pastor. Zoe isn't replacing your community. If Zoe does its job right, it's pushing you toward those things — toward your small group, toward real conversations, toward the people in your life who actually know you.

This isn't a daily devotional. It's day-long devotion.

Life with God. Not moments for God.

Made by a pastor, for pastors. And for anyone who wants to walk closer with Jesus.

## Stage Direction Notes for All Videos

- **Lighting**: Warm, natural. Avoid harsh studio lighting. Think golden hour or soft indoor lighting.
- **Setting**: Authentic. Tony's office, a coffee shop, sitting outside. Nowhere that looks "corporate."
- **Tony's delivery**: Conversational. Not rushed. Comfortable pauses. Like talking to a friend who actually gets it.
- **Camera**: Direct eye contact. Tony's talking TO the viewer, not AT them.
- **Editing**: Minimal cuts. Let Tony's natural rhythm breathe. No jump cuts every 3 seconds. This isn't TikTok.
- **Music**: Subtle if any. Acoustic, instrumental, warm. Nothing that distracts from Tony's voice.
- **Graphics**: Minimal. End screen with zoe.live and phone number. No flashy text overlays mid-speech.
- **Length reality check**: The 90-second script might run 2 minutes depending on Tony's pacing. That's fine. The "90 seconds" is a target, not a hard rule.
