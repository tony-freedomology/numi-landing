# Zoe Distribution Strategy

How to get Zoe in front of churches and individuals. Organized by channel type, timeline, and priority.

---

## Core Strategy: B2B Church-First, Individual Flywheel Second

**Why B2B first:**
- One pastor endorsement = 200-2000 users overnight
- Churches budget for discipleship tools
- Built-in trust (pastor endorsement removes "who made this?" objection)
- Deeper moat (church-aligned theology is unreplicable)

**Individual path:**
- Individuals who love Zoe become advocates
- "Would you like to connect with a local church that uses Zoe?"
- Individual users funnel into church discovery

---

## Phase 1: Pilot Churches (Months 1-3)

**Goal**: Prove the concept with 1-3 churches. Get testimonials and data.

### Channels
1. **Personal network (Tony's existing relationships)**
   - Pastors Tony knows personally
   - Churches Tony has connections with
   - Denominational contacts

2. **Warm intros**
   - Ask pilot pastors: "Who else should try this?"
   - Leverage existing relationships for referrals

3. **Beta waitlist (zoe.live)**
   - Capture emails from people interested in early access
   - Filter for church leaders
   - Personal outreach to qualified leads

### Tactics
- Free pilot (no cost, white-glove onboarding)
- Weekly check-ins with pilot pastors
- Gather detailed feedback and testimonials
- Document case studies (before/after engagement data)

### Success Metrics
- 1-3 churches signed up
- 50-200 active users across pilots
- 80%+ retention through 4-week pilot
- 2-3 strong testimonials from pastors

---

## Phase 2: Validate & Refine (Months 3-6)

**Goal**: Prove the business model. Transition to paid. Build self-service tools.

### Channels

#### 1. Church Conference Circuit (High Priority)
**Why**: Concentrated audience of church leaders. High trust environment.

**Target conferences:**
- Exponential Conference
- Orange Conference
- Catalyst
- Q Conference
- Denominational conferences (Acts 29, Wesleyan, Baptist, etc.)

**Tactics:**
- Booth (if budget allows)
- Speaking slot (if possible — Tony telling the story)
- Sponsor after-parties or breakout sessions
- QR codes everywhere ("Text START to try Zoe now")
- Collect pastor contact info for follow-up

**Timeline**: Start applying 6 months before conference dates (most conferences are annual, plan ahead)

#### 2. Podcast Appearances (High Priority)
**Why**: Pastors listen to podcasts. Tony can tell the story in his own voice.

**Target podcasts:**
- Carey Nieuwhof Leadership Podcast
- The Happy Hour with Jamie Ivey
- Training Leaders International (T.L.I.)
- The Briefing with Albert Mohler
- The Liturgists
- Mere Fidelity
- Denominations-specific podcasts

**Tactics:**
- Pitch: "I'm a pastor who built an AI companion for discipleship. Here's why I think AI can serve the Kingdom."
- Address the AI objection head-on (that's the hook)
- Offer free trial to podcast listeners (promo code: PODCASTNAME)

**Timeline**: Start pitching now. Most podcasts book 2-3 months out.

#### 3. Content Marketing (Organic Growth)
**Why**: SEO for long-term discoverability. Thought leadership for trust.

**Content types:**
- **Blog posts** (on zoe.live):
  - "Why Sunday Doesn't Last Until Monday"
  - "Can AI Serve Discipleship? (A Pastor's Perspective)"
  - "Day-Long Devotion vs. Daily Devotional"
  - "How to Keep Your Sermon Alive All Week"
  
- **Video content** (YouTube + social):
  - Tony's origin story (why I built Zoe)
  - Demo: What a day with Zoe looks like
  - Addressing the AI objection
  - Case studies from pilot churches

- **Guest posts** (external platforms):
  - Christianity Today
  - Relevant Magazine
  - Church Leaders
  - The Gospel Coalition (if theologically compatible)

**Timeline**: Publish 1-2 blog posts per month. Video content weekly (short-form for social, long-form for YouTube).

#### 4. Social Media (Organic + Paid)
**Why**: Reach pastors and individuals where they already are.

**Platforms:**
- **Instagram**: Visual storytelling (carousel ads, Reels)
- **Facebook**: Where most pastors still are (groups, ads)
- **YouTube**: Long-form content, demos, testimonials
- **Twitter/X**: Thought leadership, engage with Christian Twitter
- **LinkedIn**: Church leaders, ministry professionals

**Tactics:**
- Post 3-5x/week (mix of: testimonials, product demos, thought leadership, Scripture reflections)
- Use video (Tony talking to camera) — more personal than graphics
- Leverage UGC (user-generated content) once you have users
- Engage in comments (don't just broadcast)

**Timeline**: Start now. Consistency > volume.

#### 5. Email Marketing (Waitlist Nurture)
**Why**: Waitlist is a qualified audience. Convert them to users or pilot churches.

**Tactics:**
- 5-email nurture sequence (already written — see launch-email-sequence.md)
- Weekly newsletter once launched (case studies, tips, theology reflections)
- Segment: pastors vs. individuals (different CTAs)

**Timeline**: Start sending as soon as waitlist has 50+ people.

---

## Phase 3: Scale (Months 6-12)

**Goal**: Grow to 50-100 churches. Build individual flywheel. Establish Zoe as a category.

### Channels

#### 1. Paid Ads (Facebook/Instagram)
**Why**: Scale beyond organic reach. Target specific demographics.

**Targeting:**
- **Church leaders**: Job title (pastor, church leader, ministry), interests (church growth, discipleship)
- **Individuals**: Age 25-50, interests (Christianity, Bible study, devotional apps, prayer)

**Ad formats:**
- Carousel ads (see carousel-ad-concepts.md)
- Video ads (Tony talking to camera — see video-ad-scripts.md)
- Long-form copy ads (see long-form-copy-ads.md)

**Budget:**
- Start: $500-1000/month (test creative and audiences)
- Scale: $5k-10k/month (once you find what works)

**Timeline**: Start small (month 6). Scale aggressively once unit economics work.

#### 2. Google Ads (Search + YouTube)
**Why**: Capture intent ("SMS devotional," "discipleship tool for churches," "AI faith companion").

**Targeting:**
- **Search**: Keywords like "discipleship software," "church engagement tool," "daily devotional SMS"
- **YouTube**: Pre-roll on Christian content (sermons, worship music, Bible study channels)

**Budget:**
- Start: $1k-2k/month
- Scale: $5k-10k/month

**Timeline**: Start month 6-9 (after you've validated messaging in social ads).

#### 3. Denominational Partnerships
**Why**: Credibility + distribution. One denominational endorsement = access to hundreds of churches.

**Target denominations:**
- Acts 29 (Reformed, church planting network)
- Wesleyan Church
- Free Methodist
- Evangelical Covenant Church
- Vineyard
- Nazarene

**Tactics:**
- Pitch to denominational leadership: "We want to offer Zoe to your network at a discounted rate."
- Offer exclusive pricing for their churches
- Co-brand if needed ("Zoe for Acts 29")
- Get featured in denominational newsletters, conferences, resources

**Timeline**: Start conversations month 6. Partnerships take 6-12 months to close.

#### 4. Referral/Ambassador Program
**Why**: Turn happy users into advocates. Leverage network effects.

**Structure:**
- **For individuals**: Refer a friend, both get 1 month free
- **For churches**: Refer another church, get $100 credit
- **Ambassador tier**: Pastors who love Zoe get free access + commission for referrals

**Tactics:**
- Built into the product (Zoe prompts: "Know someone who'd benefit from this? Share zoe.live")
- Leaderboard for ambassadors (gamify it)
- Swag for top referrers (Zoe t-shirts, stickers)

**Timeline**: Launch month 9-12 (once you have critical mass of happy users).

#### 5. Church Management Software Integrations
**Why**: Meet churches where they already are. Reduce friction.

**Target integrations:**
- **Planning Center**: Sync member lists, event calendar
- **Church Community Builder (CCB)**: Member database integration
- **Breeze**: Small church CMS
- **Pushpay**: Giving platform (less relevant but high adoption)

**Tactics:**
- Build API integrations (or Zapier bridges)
- Get listed in their app marketplaces
- Co-marketing (they promote Zoe to their customer base)

**Timeline**: Month 12+ (requires eng resources, partnerships take time).

---

## Individual User Acquisition (B2C Flywheel)

**Why**: Individuals who love Zoe become advocates. They push their churches to adopt it.

### Channels

#### 1. App Store Optimization (If You Build an App)
Currently Zoe is SMS-only. But if you build an iOS/Android app later:
- Optimize for keywords: "daily devotional," "faith companion," "Bible app"
- Get featured in App Store (requires press, traction, or relationship with Apple)

#### 2. Content Marketing (SEO)
- Target keywords: "how to stay consistent with Bible reading," "faith struggles," "walking with Jesus daily"
- Long-tail content: blog posts answering specific faith questions
- YouTube: "What a day with Zoe looks like" (demo video)

#### 3. Social Media (Organic + Paid)
- Testimonial videos from individual users
- "Here's how Zoe followed up on something I mentioned three days ago" (show the magic)
- Target individuals on Instagram/TikTok (younger demo)

#### 4. Influencer/Creator Partnerships
- Christian influencers (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
- Offer free access in exchange for honest review
- Micro-influencers (10k-100k followers) often more effective than mega-influencers

## Key Metrics to Track (By Channel)

### Church Acquisition
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: How much does it cost to sign one church?

- **LTV:CAC ratio**: Target 3:1 or higher
- **Source attribution**: Which channels bring the best churches?

### Individual Acquisition
- **CAC per user**: How much to acquire one paying individual user?
- **Conversion rate**: Waitlist → trial → paid
- **Retention**: % still active after 30/60/90 days
- **Referral rate**: % of users who refer others

### Content Performance
- **Blog traffic**: Unique visitors, time on page
- **Video views**: YouTube watch time, engagement rate
- **Social engagement**: Likes, shares, comments, saves
- **Email open/click rates**: Waitlist nurture performance

## The Long Game: Building a Movement

Zoe isn't just a product. It's a bet that AI can serve the Kingdom.

The distribution strategy isn't just about ads and funnels. It's about:
- **Telling a story** people want to be part of
- **Building trust** with pastors who are skeptical
- **Creating advocates** who push their churches to adopt Zoe
- **Showing proof** that this actually helps people walk with Jesus

Every channel, every piece of content, every conversation should reinforce:
- Made by a pastor, for pastors
- Day-long devotion, not daily devotional
- Amplifying the Holy Spirit, not replacing it
- More human connection, not less

**The best distribution channel is a life changed.**

When someone texts their pastor and says, "You need to try this," that's the goal.

Everything else is just scaffolding to get there.
