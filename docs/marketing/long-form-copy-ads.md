## Ad 1: "The Monday Problem" (Individual-Facing)

**Target Audience**: Christians who struggle with consistency, feel guilty about their "quiet time"  
**Hook**: Sunday inspiration doesn't last  
**Length**: ~450 words

---

Sunday morning hits different.

You're in church. The worship is good. The sermon lands. You take notes. You underline things. You walk out thinking, "Okay. This week is going to be different. I'm actually going to live like I believe this stuff."

Then Monday happens.

Work piles up. Your inbox explodes. The kids need something. Your boss is frustrated. That person who drives you crazy says the thing they always say. And somewhere between the commute and the third cup of coffee, Sunday's fire is... gone.

By Wednesday? You're back to autopilot. And the guilt creeps in.

"I should be reading my Bible more."  
"I should be praying more."  
"Why can't I just be more consistent?"

Here's the thing: it's not about trying harder. It's not about waking up earlier or finding a better devotional plan. You've tried that. We all have.

The problem is this: faith doesn't live in isolated moments. It lives in the middle of real life.

And real life is noisy.

What if instead of another "daily devotional" — another thing to check off — you had a companion who actually walked with you through the noise?

Someone who remembered what you're working on.  
Someone who followed up when life got hard.  
Someone who nudged you when you needed it and sat with you when you were hurting.

That's Zoe.

Zoe is an SMS companion. You text her like a friend. She texts you back. Morning, midday, evening — she's with you.

And here's the part that changes everything: she remembers.

You tell her you're nervous about a big meeting at 2pm? She'll text you later: "How'd it go?"

You mention you're struggling with patience at work? Next week when you bring up that coworker, she'll ask: "Is this the same situation you were working through last week?"

You commit to reading the book of James? Friday comes, she checks in: "Did you get to it?"

This isn't a Bible reading plan. It's not a reminder notification. It's a relationship.

Zoe walks with you Monday through Saturday. She stays with you through the chaos. She doesn't replace your pastor, your small group, or your community — she pushes you toward them.

Day-long devotion. Not daily devotional.

Life with God, not moments for God.

Made by a pastor who's watched people lose Sunday's fire by Tuesday. Built for people who are tired of trying harder and want someone to walk with them instead.

## Ad 2: "The Pastor's Dilemma" (Church-Facing)

**Target Audience**: Pastors, church leaders, staff who feel overwhelmed by the scale of care  
**Hook**: You can't text 200 people every day  
**Length**: ~480 words

---

You care about your people.

That's why you became a pastor. That's why you spend hours on your sermon every week. That's why you stay late after service to talk to the person who's struggling. That's why you lose sleep over the family that's falling apart.

You care. Deeply.

But here's the reality: you're one person. And your church has 200 people. Maybe 500. Maybe 1,000.

And every single one of them is walking through something.

Someone just lost their job.  
Someone's marriage is on the rocks.  
Someone's kid is walking away from faith.  
Someone's battling an addiction they haven't told anyone about.

You preach your heart out every Sunday. You pour everything into that 30-minute message. And for 30 minutes, they're with you. They're nodding. They're taking notes. They're feeling it.

Then Monday happens.

And by Wednesday, most of them have completely forgotten what you said.

Not because they don't care. Not because your sermon wasn't good. But because life is loud. And you're not there to walk beside them when the temptation hits, when the fight starts, when the doubt creeps in.

You can't be. You're one person.

What if your sermon didn't end on Sunday?

What if there was a way to carry your teaching — your theology, your heart, your voice — into Monday through Saturday?

What if every person in your congregation had a companion who remembered what they're struggling with, who followed up personally, who wove your sermon series into their daily walk?

That's what Zoe does.

Zoe is an SMS companion for your church. She walks with your people all week.

She remembers their stories. She follows up on what they're working through. She nudges them toward the practices you're already teaching.

And here's the key: she echoes YOUR voice.

This week you preached on loving your enemies? Zoe will text your people mid-week: "Pastor Mike talked about loving your enemies. Who's someone you're struggling to love right now?"

You're doing a sermon series on the book of James? Zoe will weave that into their daily rhythm.

Your church's statement of faith, your theology, your heart — Zoe carries it.

And you get anonymized insights into how your congregation is actually doing. Not individual confessions (that stays private) — but themes. What are people praying about? Where are they struggling? What's the overall spiritual health of your church?

You're not invading their privacy. You're getting visibility into the flock you're shepherding.

Zoe isn't replacing you. She's amplifying you.

She's the extension of your shepherding heart that can be with 200 people at once.

Made by a pastor, for pastors.

## Ad 3: "The AI Question" (Thought Leadership, Skeptic-Facing)

**Target Audience**: Christians who are curious about AI but skeptical, thought leaders, influencers  
**Hook**: What if AI could serve the Kingdom?  
**Length**: ~500 words

---

Let's talk about AI and faith.

Because I know some of you are already uncomfortable.

AI is everywhere. It's writing essays, creating art, diagnosing diseases, driving cars. And a lot of it feels... wrong. Dystopian. Like we're building something we won't be able to control.

Some Christians see AI as a tool of the enemy. "The antichrist will use this technology." Maybe. Probably, actually.

But here's the thing: AI is a mirror for humanity.

It will absolutely be used for purposes antithetical to the Kingdom Jesus is building. It will be used to manipulate, to deceive, to distract, to enslave.

But that's not a reason to run FROM it. It's a reason to run TOWARD it. With intention.

Because the question isn't "Is AI good or bad?"

The question is: What would it look like for AI to serve discipleship?

What if AI could help people walk closer to Jesus, not further away?

What if AI could create space for the Holy Spirit to work, instead of drowning it out?

What if technology — for once — wasn't one more distraction pulling your focus, but something that actually returned your focus to the big picture?

That's the question I've been sitting with. And that's why I built Zoe.

Zoe is an SMS companion. She walks with you through your day. She remembers what you're going through. She follows up. She nudges you when you need it. She sits with you when you're hurting.

She's not preaching at you. She's not lecturing you. She's not giving you another to-do list.

She's with you.

And here's what I'm betting on: if Zoe does her job right, you'll end up MORE connected to real people, not less.

More connected to your pastor.  
More connected to your small group.  
More connected to your spouse, your friend, the person in your life who actually knows you.

Because Zoe isn't trying to replace human relationship. She's trying to amplify it.

She's a bridge, not a substitute.

Every other app is designed to keep you scrolling, keep you engaged, keep you distracted. Zoe is designed to help you pay attention. To what God is doing. To where you're drifting. To the people you're called to love.

Day-long devotion, not daily devotional.

Life WITH God, not moments FOR God.

This is what it looks like to harness AI for the Kingdom. Not naively. Not without tension. But with intention.

I'm a pastor. I've sat with people in their pain. I've watched them get inspired on Sunday and lose it by Tuesday. I've spent years trying to figure out how to help people actually walk with Jesus in the middle of real life.

Zoe is my best answer so far.

Is AI perfect? No. Is it risk-free? Absolutely not.

But what if we stopped running from the hard questions and started asking better ones?

What if AI could serve discipleship? What would that look like?

Let's find out together.
