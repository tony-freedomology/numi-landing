## Visual Direction Notes (All Carousels)

### Photography Style
- **NOT stock photos** — no overly polished, teeth-whitened, fake "diverse group laughing at salad" vibes
- **Real texture** — grain is good, imperfect lighting is good, lived-in spaces
- **Cinematic framing** — shallow depth of field, thoughtful composition, intentional negative space
- **Warm color grading** — avoid cold blues and harsh whites; lean into golden hour, amber, earth tones

### Text Overlay
- **Sans-serif, bold, readable** — this is Instagram/Facebook, not a design portfolio
- **High contrast** — white text on dark images, dark text on light images, always legible
- **Generous padding** — don't cram text to the edges
- **Max 2 lines for headlines, 1-2 short sentences for supporting text**

### Mood Board References
- A24 film stills (muted, moody, real)
- Brandon Woelfel (warm, bokeh, intimate)
- Kinfolk magazine (minimalist, textured, human)
- NOT: Canva templates, stock Christian imagery, overly bright/happy vibes

### Image Sourcing
- Custom photography if budget allows (Tony with phone, real church spaces, real people)
- Unsplash/Pexels if needed, but HIGHLY curated (avoid obvious stock)
- Phone screenshots should be real Zoe text conversations (or realistic mockups)
