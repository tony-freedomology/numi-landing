# Trust & Privacy Landing Section (Draft Copy)

Use this on both `/` and `/churches` pages. Keep language concrete and avoid absolute claims that product cannot enforce yet.

## Section Headline Options
- Private by default. Transparent by design.
- Your prayers are personal. Your controls are real.
- Built for spiritual depth, built with privacy first.

## Section Subhead
Zoe is designed as an interactive prayer journal with proactive support. Your private conversations stay private by default, with clear consent controls and auditability.

## Proof Pillars (3-5 cards)
1. Private by default
- Your one-to-one conversations are not visible to your church leaders by default.

2. Aggregated church insights only
- Churches see trend-level insights, not individual confessions or prayer details.

3. Human access locked down
- Human access is restricted, logged, and limited to specific support or safety workflows.

4. Consent controls
- You can choose memory depth, AI improvement sharing, and support access settings.

5. Delete and export rights
- You can request your data export or delete your account and conversation history.

## Recommended CTA Block
- Primary CTA: `See Privacy Controls`
- Secondary CTA: `Read Full Privacy Policy`
- Helper text: `No app required. Privacy settings available in your account controls.`

## FAQ Copy (Individuals)
### Who can see my thoughts?
By default, your private Zoe conversations are only used to deliver Zoe. Your church does not see your individual message content unless you explicitly share something.

### Does my pastor read my messages?
No, not by default. Church leaders see aggregated trends to support discipleship at a whole-community level.

### Do humans at Zoe read my messages?
Not by default. Human access is restricted and audited. If support access is needed, it is consent-driven except in urgent safety situations.

### Is my data used to train AI models?
Not by default. AI improvement/data-sharing settings are opt-in.

### Can I turn memory off?
Yes. You can choose your memory mode, including minimal-memory options.

### Can I delete my data?
Yes. You can request export and deletion options, including full account deletion.

### What happens in a crisis?
We prioritize safety with a consent-first approach whenever possible. In imminent risk situations, minimum necessary information may be used to protect life.

## FAQ Copy (Church Leaders)
### Will we see private confessions?
No. Zoe is built so church dashboards show aggregated, de-identified trends rather than member-level private conversation content.

### How do we handle privacy objections from members?
Use this framing: private by default, consent controls, transparent policy, and clear delete/export rights.

### Can leaders access direct message logs?
Not by default. Any exceptional access path should be role-restricted, audited, and policy-bound.

## Suggested Microcopy Near Forms/CTAs

## Disclosure Footer Snippet
Zoe uses trusted service providers (messaging, hosting, AI, billing) to operate the product. We minimize data sent to providers and enforce contractual/privacy controls. See Privacy Policy for details.
