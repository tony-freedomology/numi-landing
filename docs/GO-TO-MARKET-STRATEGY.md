## The Window

AI discipleship tools are emerging but nobody owns the category yet. Apps like Hallow exist but are Catholic-focused and app-based. Zoe is a Freedomology product — part of the technology branch of the Freedomology ecosystem. Its differentiator: SMS-native (no app download), scripture study nerd energy (not generic devotional), and church-aligned (B2B distribution). The window to define "SMS discipleship" as a category is NOW.

### Freedomology Ecosystem

Freedomology is the parent brand — a company built around helping people live at the intersection of health, wealth, and relationships. Zoe is the technology arm focused on faith and discipleship.

**The Freedomology Portfolio:**
- **Health:** ADAM (metabolic pre-day drink)
- **Wealth:** Freedomology coaching platform
- **Faith/Technology:** Zoe (SMS discipleship tool)
- **Media:** Freedomology Studios
  - AI + Faith podcast (Tony + Clint) — drives Zoe awareness
  - Freedomology Life podcast (Greg + guests) — drives broader brand
  - Short films, documentaries

**Why this matters for Zoe GTM:**
- Freedomology has an existing audience and brand trust
- Greg is aligned on the vision and likely to support distribution
- The podcast ecosystem cross-pollinates: someone discovers the AI+faith show → gets into Zoe → discovers Freedomology → tries ADAM
- Zoe is the proof of concept for the technology branch. Ship it well, and it validates the whole portfolio model.

AI discipleship tools are emerging but nobody owns the category yet. Apps like Hallow exist but are Catholic-focused and app-based. Zoe's differentiator: SMS-native (no app download), scripture study nerd energy (not generic devotional), and church-aligned (B2B distribution). The window to define "SMS discipleship" as a category is NOW — 6-12 months before bigger players catch on.

## Phase 1: Beta Launch & Validation (Weeks 1-4)

### Pastor Network Activation
Tony's real-life pastor network is the fastest path to product-market fit.

**Immediate actions:**
- Identify 3-5 pastors willing to pilot Zoe with their congregation
- Offer free for the pilot period (3 months)
- White-glove onboarding: Tony personally sets up each church
- Ask each pastor to invite 10-30 members initially (not whole congregation)
- Weekly check-in with each pastor: what's working, what's awkward, what's missing?

**What you're looking for:**
- Which touchpoints do people actually respond to? (morning/midday/evening)
- Do people request custom reading plans? (validate the sticky feature)
- What do pastors care about most? (engagement data? sermon integration? pastoral alerts?)
- What makes people stop? (too many texts? wrong timing? content feels generic?)
- Collect EXACT quotes for testimonials — "Zoe helped me..." stories

**Beta success metrics:**
- 60%+ of invited members still active after 2 weeks
- At least 3 unprompted positive testimonials
- At least 1 pastor says "I'd pay for this"
- Discovery of at least 1 use case you didn't anticipate

### Individual Beta (Parallel)
- Open waitlist on zoe.live (already have this)
- Let in 20-50 individuals from waitlist during beta
- These are your B2C test group — different needs than church members
- Track: do individuals stick without a pastor/community context?

---

## Phase 2: Ads + Positioning Testing (Weeks 2-8, overlaps with Phase 1)

### Facebook/Instagram Ads
Start small ($20-50/day) testing different angles:

**Angle 1 — The Problem**
"You set your alarm for a quiet time. By Tuesday you've already forgotten. Sound familiar?"
Target: Christians 25-45, interested in Bible, prayer, church

**Angle 2 — The Product**
"What if your Bible study texted YOU every morning with exactly what to read — plus the historical context most people miss?"
Target: Same

**Angle 3 — The Pastor Angle**
"Built by a pastor who got tired of watching his congregation's faith stay in the pew on Sundays."
Target: Pastors, church leaders, church admin

**Angle 4 — The AI Question**
"What would it look like for Christians to actually harness AI for the Kingdom instead of fearing it?"
Target: Broader Christian audience, thought leadership

**What you're testing:**
- Which angle gets the cheapest clicks?
- Which angle converts to waitlist signups?
- Which headlines make people stop scrolling?
- B2B (church) vs B2C (individual) — which converts better from ads?

### Carousel Ads (Already Built)
Use the 5 carousel sets already in Google Drive:
- sunday-to-monday (individual hook)
- pastor-burden (church empathy)
- daily-rhythm (feature showcase)
- ai-question (thought leadership)
- for-churches (B2B direct)

Test each carousel against each audience. Let the data tell you which positioning wins.

## Phase 3: Content & Authority Engine (Weeks 4-12)

### The Podcast Ecosystem (Tony + Clint)

This is the long-game authority play that makes everything else work.

**Podcast Concept: "The Zoe Life Podcast" (or keep "Open to Truth")**
- AI + Faith intersection — the philosophical, practical, and theological implications
- Clint brings PhD philosophy rigor
- Tony brings everyman language + builder energy
- Build the product in public — share what you're learning in real time
- Interview pastors using Zoe, discuss what's working
- Wrestle with the big questions: Is AI the antichrist? Can AI help you pray? What does discipleship look like in 2026?

**Why this is powerful:**
1. Content engine: every episode becomes 3-5 blog posts, social clips, newsletter content
2. Authority: a pastor + philosopher discussing AI and faith = instant E-E-A-T for Google AND LLMs
3. Distribution: podcast listeners become Zoe users, Zoe users become podcast listeners
4. SEO gold: podcast transcripts become long-form content that LLMs love to cite
5. Third-party mentions: guests link to you, mention you, create the off-site presence that AI search requires

**Episode ideas (first 10):**
1. "We built an AI discipleship tool. Here's what happened."
2. "Is AI the antichrist? A philosopher and a pastor disagree."
3. "What the early church can teach us about technology adoption"
4. "We gave 50 people an AI Bible study partner. The results surprised us." (beta data)
5. "The ethics of AI in pastoral care — where's the line?"
6. "Why your quiet time isn't working (and what to do instead)"
7. "Can AI help you pray? We tried it for 30 days."
8. "What pastors actually need from church technology"
9. "The attention economy vs. the kingdom economy"
10. "Building in public: month 1 of Zoe"

### Blog/Content Hub on zoe.live

**Pillar pages (high priority, write these first):**
- /guides/sms-discipleship — define the category, own the phrase
- /guides/church-follow-up-texting — practical guide for pastors
- /about — Tony's story, why this exists, pastor credentials front and center

**Journey packs (indexable pages that LLMs will cite):**
- /journeys/new-believer-30-days
- /journeys/book-of-james-14-day-plan
- /journeys/prayer-week
- /journeys/gospel-of-mark-reading-plan
Each includes: overview, who it's for, sample message excerpts, what the experience looks like

**Comparison content (honest, balanced — LLMs reward this):**
- /compare/zoe-vs-church-apps
- /compare/zoe-vs-group-texting
- /compare/sms-vs-app-discipleship

**FAQ content (structured for AI citation):**
- Will this cause people to form unhealthy relationships with AI?
- Is this replacing my pastor or small group?
- How is this different from a Bible app?
- What translations does Zoe support?
- How do opt-in and opt-out work?
- Can my pastor see my conversations? (NO — privacy)

## Phase 4: SEO & AI Search Optimization (Ongoing from Week 4)

### Technical SEO (Do immediately on the Next.js site)

**Schema markup (JSON-LD):**
```json

## Competitive Positioning

### Zoe vs Hallow
- Hallow: Catholic-focused app, meditation/prayer, requires download
- Zoe: Protestant/non-denominational, SMS-native (no download), scripture study + accountability, church-aligned
- Key differentiator: Zoe lives in your texts. No app to forget to open.

### Zoe vs Bible Apps (YouVersion, etc.)
- Bible apps: content libraries, reading plans, passive
- Zoe: proactive, reaches out to YOU, remembers your context, holds you accountable
- Key differentiator: Zoe is an elbow in the ribs, not a bookshelf.

### Zoe vs Group Texting (GroupMe, WhatsApp)
- Group texting: human-driven, inconsistent, labor-intensive for pastors
- Zoe: automated + personalized, scales without burning out volunteers
- Key differentiator: Zoe scales discipleship without scaling staff.

### Category creation: "SMS Discipleship"
Nobody owns this phrase yet. Zoe should define it, explain it, and be the first result when anyone — human or AI — searches for it.
